## Devlogs
### W1
Write your W1 activity Devlog here.
"Hello world!"
### W2
Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.
### Question 1
Why are the r, g, and b variables floats instead of ints, bools, or strings?
It's because if they were static integers there wouldn't be color range. Bools are true or false arguements so that just wouldn't make sense on colors. Also strings are just for dialogue.
### Question 2
Why is the _bounce variable an int instead of a float, bool, or string?
This is because it's an integer. The code can't calculate for half a bounce or .5 of a bounce. It's one bounce at a time, or one whole number at a time.
### Question 3
The error you got after Step 4 of Part 2 told you something useful about why that line of code was broken- what was it?
Not going to lie I kind of worked past it so I don't remember the exact error. I went back and fixed some compiler errors I saw in the console and they were things like missing semi-colons, "f" floats after numbers, improper variable spelling. Also I had an issue with the blue rgb value not changing from  0, which I was able to see in the console, so I altered some of the code.
